% Turabian Formatting for Theses and Dissertations, 2018/08/06
%
% Developed using the turabian-formatting package (2018/08/01), available through CTAN: http://www.ctan.org/pkg/turabian-formatting
%
% Additional document class formatting options:
%
% raggedright: ragged right formatting without hyphenations
% authordate: support for the author-date citation style
% endnotes: support for endnotes

% document class handles the big-picture formatting
\documentclass{turabian-thesis}

% For Turabian citations, use the biblatex-chicago package
\usepackage[noibid]{biblatex-chicago}
\addbibresource{backmatter/works-cited.bib}

\addbibresource{backmatter/citations.bib}


% inputenc handles unicode (i.e. non-ASCII characters, such as letters with umlauts). This may need changing, depending on what you're using to compile (LuaTex, pdftex, etc.)
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% graphicx handles graphics. Requisite for hyperref, don't worry about this.
\usepackage{graphicx}


% hyperlinks! The option [hidelinks] makes it still black i.e. not obviously a hyperlink. Remove [hidelinks] to make it the classic hyperlink style.
% \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
% \hypersetup{
%     colorlinks = false,
%     linkbordercolor = {white},
%     urlcolor = {blue}
% }

% For lorem ipsum text. use \lipsum[5] to create placeholder text. Increase the number in the brackets for more text.
% Very handy to get an overview of how it's going to look, but also can make you feel unreasonably confident- beware!
\usepackage{lipsum}

% it's unwise to mess with anything in this section- all of these are great packages, and if you don't use them, then LaTex doesn't include them, so there's no reason to turn them off.
% I have included some search tags in the hope that they're useful. Refer to the package's documentation for further information about how to implement them.
