assimilation of extended techniques and preparations. The research documents the process from inception
to creative output. Through an emergent, practice-led initial research phase, I fashion a developmental
framework for assimilating new techniques and preparations into my musical vocabulary. The developmental
framework has the potential to be linear, reflexive or flexible depending on context, and as such the
tangible outcomes can be either finished creative works, development of new techniques, or knowledge
about organisational aspects of placing the techniques in musical settings. Analysis of creative works is
an integral part of the developmental framework and forms the bulk of this dissertation. The analytical
essays within contain new knowledge about extended techniques, their potential and limitations, and
realities inherent in their use in both compositional and improvisational contexts. Video, audio, notation
and photos are embedded throughout the dissertation and form an integral part of the research project.
Engagement with the media at appropriate junctures in the analysis is intended to enhance the narrative
of the dissertation and facilitate a greater comprehension of the knowledge contained therein.},

  abstract = {The impetus for this study was the question of whether extended techniques are actually being taught in college trumpet studio settings as standard skills necessary on the instrument. The specific purposes of this document included: (1) catalogue the extended techniques available to today's trumpet performer, (2) reflect on their current use and address the question of how and when students are introduced to extended techniques, (3) contribute pedagogical exercises and suggestions to aid trumpeters in the study of some of the more challenging techniques, and (4) conclude with a "Guided Approach" to the literature detailing suggestions for the study of the twenty pieces referenced in this document. A survey was conducted of the current pedagogical status of extended techniques at the collegiate level. The online survey, which included questions regarding how and when students are introduced to extended techniques in their study of the trumpet, was completed by 166 college and university trumpet studio teachers from the United States and Canada. Examination of the results offers a unique view of the attention currently being given to extended techniques in college trumpet studios; they provide insight into specific teaching materials and performance repertoire being used by studio teachers today. Within each chapter pedagogical exercises assist in the study of certain techniques. The exercises are written as an introduction to many of these techniques, offering opportunities to experiment with the more challenging techniques before encountering them in the literature. Two specific techniques, multiphonics and flutter tonguing, are covered in greater detail with a larger collection of exercises. Pedagogical suggestions offered by the survey respondents are also included. Finally, the "Guided Approach" to the literature was compiled. Twenty pieces were selected and arranged in an order that provides a progressive approach to extended techniques. Each piece is catalogued through an individual profile which provides practical information regarding the piece: date, publication information, length, range, style of notation used, equipment requirements, who the piece was commissioned by or written for, a listing of all extended techniques employed, a listing of existing recordings, and a commentary concerning its particular challenges and benefits of study. The goal is to provide a resource for those who might not be familiar with the repertoire and help them choose appropriate literature for their students' level of experience with these techniques. There exists a need for additional pedagogical materials that can be used to introduce extended techniques to students of the trumpet. The document is designed to aid the serious student of the trumpet in meeting all the expectations of the repertoire.

            Considerable research has been made into the harmonic properties and playability of woodwind multiphonics, while the utility of string multiphonics has received far less attention. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing amount of interest in the topic, and several publications have been devoted to acoustic guitar multiphonics. Primarily written for non-guitarist composers, these studies range from the scientific to the practical. Variously, they describe the sonic qualities of the multiphonics, discuss methods of performing them, or examine their spectral content and morphology. Until now, published research into guitar multiphonics has been limited to the acoustic guitar and has examined only its three lower strings. In this study, we analyse multiphonics on all six strings of the electric guitar and present a catalogue of harmonic aggregates on strings 3–1. We test these multiphonics on five different guitars and examine their response to three commonly used analogue effect pedals (compression, overdrive and distortion). In order to precisely indicate the spectral components and harmonic nodes, we have used the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation (HEJI).},

  abstract = {Of the many waveforms the bowed string can assume, the so-called “Helmholtz motion”
(Helmholtz 1862) gives the fullest sound in terms of power and overtone richness. The
development of this steady-state oscillation pattern can take many different paths, most of
which would include noise caused by stick-slip irregularities of the bow-string contact. Of the
five papers included in the thesis, the first one shows, not surprisingly, that tone onsets are
considered superior when the attack noise has a very limited duration. It was found, however,
that in this judgment the character of the noise plays an important part, as the listener’s
tolerance of noise in terms of duration is almost twice as great for “slipping noise” as for
“creaks” or “raucousness” during the tone onsets. The three following papers contain analyses
focusing on how irregular slip-stick triggering may be avoided, as is quite often the case in
practical playing by professionals. The fifth paper describes the triggering mechanism of a
peculiar tone production referred to as “Anomalous Low Frequencies” (ALF). If properly
skilled, a player can achieve pitches below the normal range of the instrument. This
phenomenon is related to triggering waves taking “an extra turn” on the string before causing
the string’s release from the bow-hair grip. Since transverse and torsional propagation speeds
are both involved, two different sets of “sub-ranged” notes can be produced this way. In the
four last papers wave patterns are analysed and explained through the use of computer
simulations.},

  abstract = {By carefully positioning the bow and a lightly touching finger on the string, the string spectrum can
be conditioned to provide narrow bands of pronounced energy. This leaves the impression of multiple complex tones with the normal (Helmholtz) fundamental as the lowest pitch. The phenomenon
is seen to be caused by two additional signal loops, one on each side of the finger, which through
the repeating slip pattern get phase locked to the full loop of the fundamental. Within the nominal
period, however, the slip pulses will not be uniform like they are during the production of a normal
“harmonic” or “flageolet” but may vary considerably in shape, size, and timing. For each string,
there is a large number of bow/finger combinations that bear the potential of producing such tones.
There are also two classes, depending on whether the bow or the finger is situated closest to the
bridge. Touching the string with the finger closest to the bridge will somewhat emphasize the
(Helmholtz) fundamental. The technique is applicable to double bass and cello, while less practical
on shorter-stringed instruments. Analyses based on impulse responses and the Poisson summation
formula provide an explanation to the underlying system properties.},

Overtone singing is where one person sings in two voices, the first voice represented by the fundamental and the second by an enhanced harmonic. Overtone singing is performed in chest register. Tuning of the first or second formant and a reduction of the formant bandwidth down to 20 Hz make harmonics prominent. Narrowing the pharynx, velar constriction, variation of the small mouth opening, and a tension of the walls of the mouth cavity are used. Changing prominent harmonics has the effect of creating an overtone melody with sustained tones, tone steps, and trillos.},

  abstract = {Hermann von Helmholtz and Carl Stumpf on Consonance and Dissonance. The article juxtaposes Hermann von Helmholtz's work in the experimental physiology of hearing and Carl Stumpf's tone psychology, focusing on the problem of consonance and dissonance in music. It argues that the experimental set-up plays a major role in the approaches to hearing of both Helmholtz and Stumpf, shaping their redefinition of the musical concepts of consonance and dissonance. Helmholtz, however, explains dissonance as resulting from the beats that are heard when sound waves interfere, while Stumpf explains consonance from the fusion (Verschmelzung) of sounds, noting that two tones, depending on their distance cannot always be recognized as two but are heard as one single tone. Helmholtz's definition of dissonance eventually threatens his own theory of hearing, which is based on the mechanical principle of resonance and considers sound to be composed of sinusoidal waves. Both the physical and the mathematical tools he uses cannot easily be brought into accordance with his experimental findings on beats, which ask for a discrimination of fast changes in intensity. Dissonance thus becomes “unrecomendable” for Helmholtz, because it overstrains the ear. Stumpf's research, in contrast, has its point of departure in the historically given set of intervals and tries to find a principle that would explain this choice. His tests with experimental subjects who have no conscious knowledge of musical harmony and prove incapable to follow or reproduce music reveals to him a difference between the unity and multiplicity of tones.},

  abstract = {There was a drastic shift in the aesthetics of music from the twentieth century, and this placed new performance demands on musicians. These technical and expressive demands often include extended techniques, which are methods for producing novel timbres. This study undertakes an examination of these extended techniques on the viola. It is necessary for the modern violist to be familiar with extended techniques, but they are not part of standard training on the instrument, as the majority of the standard etudes come from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and do not address modern technical challenges. Because contemporary pedagogical literature is scarce for the viola and few etudes address extended techniques, six etudes have been commissioned as a practical application for this project. These etudes help to introduce and refine facility with extended techniques for students at an intermediate level.  
Extended techniques are often learned when a student is advanced, but they can and should be taught to younger students. The techniques are sometimes thought of as being unusual or challenging, but they are based on fundamental techniques and can contribute to and improve overall technical and musical abilities. This project begins with an introduction and a literature review, followed by the third chapter which provides a context for extended techniques with a brief history of the instrument and its pedagogy. The fourth chapter explores various extended techniques, the fifth chapter discusses the commissioned etudes, and the conclusion reiterates the importance of learning extended techniques.},

  abstract = {The study examines the development and performance of extended flute techniques since Berio’s Sequenza of 1958 to 2001. The project considers the unprecedented expansion of flute techniques since the Sequenza and the profound impact this has had on performance practice in new music composed for the flute. It addresses a number of critical issues faced by flautists in the absence of a standardised pedagogy and inconsistency of notation, and explores the role of the performer as a contributor in the performance of new music. The submission takes the form of four compact disc recordings of repertoire chosen from a wide timeframe, beginning with Claude Debussy’s Prélude à l'après-midi d’un faune of 1894 and moving through to Daniel Börtz’s Tinted Paintings in 2001. The repertoire was selected in order to highlight and explore problems encountered when performing extended techniques, and to demonstrate the ways in which various extended techniques are used by composers. In so doing the study brings into focus important issues of modern flute performance practice, and suggests possible strategies for addressing various technical and interpretative challenges.},

These are believed to play only a minor role for stabilizing vibrations and no role for perception. Here, torsion is measured on both sides of the bow contact point for a variety of bridge-bow distances on a cello string. Every periodic string release is preceeded by a reverse torsional motion independent from bowing position or dynamics. Transverse and torsional motions are coupled and there are cases of stabilization, but also cases of perturbation or surrender. Structural and timing analyses of torsional waves suggest that the earlier concepts of differential slipping can be essentially confirmed while the concept of Schelleng ripples cannot be confirmed and the concept of subharmonics is under question.},

              Natural harmonics, i.e. partials and their harmonic series, may be isolated on a vibrating string by lightly touching specific points along its length. In addition to the two endpoints, stationary 
              nodes 
              for a given partial 
              n 
              present themselves at 
              n 
              − 1 locations along the string, dividing it into 
              n 
              parts of equal length. It is not the case, however, that touching any one of these nodes will necessarily isolate the 
              n 
              th partial and its integer multiples. The subset of nodes that will activate the

              th partial (termed 
              playable nodes 
              by the authors) may be derived by following a mathematically predictable pattern described by so-called 
              Farey sequences 
              . The authors derive properties of these sequences and connect them to physical phenomena. This article describes various musical applications: locating single natural harmonics, forming melodies of neighbouring harmonics, sounding multiphonic aggregates, as well as predicting the relative tuneability of just intervals.},

  abstract = {Despite a number of recent studies on the production of multiphonics in woodwinds, an exhaustive study on the perception of these sonorities is still missing. We undertake a comparative study of saxophone multiphonics from the musical, perceptual, and acoustical points of view. We propose four major classes based on the analysis of the musical attributes and playing techniques of a set of 118 alto saxophone multiphonics, spanning all the possible sonorities previously reported. Then, we perform a dissimilarity rating experiment for all possible pairs of a subset of 15 representative multiphonics. This experiment provides confidence in the suggested classification, since the four classes are segregated in a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) representation. We also find two possible acoustical correlates of the perceptual dimensions: the spectral centroid (SC) and the modulation frequency (MF). Finally, this last representation is explored through morphing trajectories, which correspond to multiphonics that change the timbre and musical interval organization with fixed fingering.

The book considers how creative practice can lead to research insights through what is often known as practice-led research. But unlike other books on practice-led research, it balances this with discussion of how research can impact positively on creative practice through research-led practice. The editors posit an iterative and web-like relationship between practice and research. Essays within the book cover a wide range of disciplines including creative writing, dance, music, theatre, film and new media, and the contributors are from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The subject is approached from numerous angles: the authors discuss methodologies of practice-led research and research-led practice, their own creative work as a form of research, research training for creative practitioners, and the politics and histories of practice-led research and research-led practice within the university. The book will be invaluable for creative practitioners, researchers, students in the creative arts and university leaders. Key Features The first book to document, conceptualise and analyse practice-led research in the creative arts and to balance it with research-led practice Written by highly qualified academics and practitioners across the creative arts and sciences Brings together empirical, cultural and creative approaches Presents illuminating case histories of creative work and practice-led research},

  abstract = {The aim of my study is to enable a broader knowledge and compositional use of the piano multiphonics in current music.
This corpus of text will benefit pianists and composers alike, and it provides the answers to the questions "what is a piano
multiphonic", "what does a multiphonic sound like," and "how to notate a multiphonic sound".
New terminology will be defined and inaccuracies in existing terminology will be dealt with. The multiphonic "mode of
playing" will be separated from "playing technique" and from flageolets.
Moreover, multiphonics in the repertoire are compared from the aspects of composition and notation, and the portability of
multiphonics to the sounds of other instruments or to other mobile playing modes of the manipulated grand piano are
examined.
Composers tend to use multiphonics in a different manner, making for differing notational choices. This study examines
notational choices and proposes a notation suitable for most situations, and notates the most commonly produceable
multiphonic chords.
The existence of piano multiphonics will be verified mathematically, supported by acoustic recordings and camera
measurements. In my work, the correspondence of FFT analysis and hearing will be touched on, and by virtue of audio
excerpts I offer ways to improve as a listener of multiphonics.
It is observed that to produce of multiphonics the musician needs to have specialized knowledge, a small amount of
technique and detailed instructions from the composer. Multiphonics are not impossible to produce, contrary to what a
lack of prior literature would suggest},

            Multiphonics on vibrating strings have been an important element in my compositions since the early 1990s. In order to calculate the frequency components of so-called pure multiphonics (multiphonics consisting of harmonic partials of the fundamental) on vibrating strings, I developed my fraction windowing algorithm. The first section of this article details the use of multiphonics in my compositions and the second section discusses how the fraction windowing algorithm works and its relationship to the closely related mathematical concept of a continued fraction. The article also discusses the online apps I have developed as tools for composers and performers who are interested in using these methods in their own work on string multiphonics.},

Clarinet Multiphonics is a multi-component thesis that looks into the entire area of
multiphonic analysis and composition for the bass clarinet. A literary section of the thesis
looks at past publications and the problems associated with using this contemporary
technique, in terms of both compositional and performance issues. A theoretical analysis
of Type One multiphonics gives an insight into how multiphonics on the bass clarinet work
in a more scientific way and their close relationship with the harmonic series. A complete
analysis of Type Two multiphonics using past charts and new-found fingerings results in
the creation of the new SW multiphonic charts for the bass clarinet. The new SW charts
are fully tested by correcting problems in past compositions by means of several student
compositional projects at various UK universities. Finally, a new set of études and pieces
have been commissioned by composers from the UK and abroad. The results and
successes of the pieces and new SW charts are analysed and can be listened to via
accompanying audio and data CDs.
The results of this thesis provide both performers and composers with an accurate,
exhaustive and up-to-date usable publication. Not only does this thesis provide a new set
of multiphonic charts, but the addition of compositional examples using multiphonics
provides both practice and recital material for performers and useful compositional
technique hints and advice for composers wishing to use this resource in the future.},

            This article forms part of ‘The Microtonal Piano – and the tuned-in interpreter’, an ongoing artistic research project at the Norwegian Academy of Music that seeks to demonstrate how microtonality can increase the expressive possibilities of the acoustic piano. Many different modes of playing can result in microtonal sounds, and this article presents a preliminary overview of these possibilities. For the project, new works have been commissioned from several composers, and different aspects of microtonal modes of playing are integrated into these works. Multiphonics is obviously one of these modes of playing, as it most often results in microtonality. At the end of the article, different ways that multiphonics can be modified when used in combination with some of the other microtonal modes of playing are suggested.},
