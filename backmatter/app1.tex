% \section*{Program Notes}
% % \violinPiece\space is a solo work for violin that explores \hyperref[sec:half-harmonics]{half-harmonics}.
% It is a non-programmatic work, and the title was inspired by a question that my supervisor posed to me while I sought ethics approval for my exegesis; a simple phrase laden with possible contexts, spurring the imagination to try and complete the meaning.

% % It is, in a way, an etude, treating the half-harmonics in a way similar to those found in Sciarrino's \hyperref[fig:sciarrinoExcerpt]{\emph{6 Caprricio for violin}}. 
% Half-harmonics are produced by applying left hand finger pressure halfway between that required to create a harmonic, and a \emph{normale} sound. 
% The sound that is produced should be a mixture of the stopped string pitch, the harmonic pitch, and a resistant, slightly noisy quality.
% % They are notated in the score as a half-filled diamond notehead.

% \section*{Notation}
% \begin{itemize}

%     \item Half-harmonics are notated in the score as a half-filled diamond notehead.
%     \item Arrows denote gradual transitions to the technique that the arrow is pointing to.\begin{itemize}
%         \item Arrows between notes denote transitions between the types of notes (i.e.\ \emph{normale} to harmonic finger pressure.)
%       \end{itemize}
%     % \item sp denotes \emph{sul ponticello}.
%     % \item msp denotes \emph{molto sul ponticello}.
%     % \item similarly, st denotes \emph{sul tasto}, and mst denotes \emph{molto sul tasto}
% \end{itemize}
