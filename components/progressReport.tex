\section{Progress Overview}
In July 2020, I began my PhD project titled `Writing Wrong Right: Composing with Extended Techniques', with Dr.\ Maria Grenfell and Dr.\ Sean Priest supervising.
My initial focus was on the collation of practical advice for composers seeking to write music incorporating extended techniques, but since then, has shifted to a broader topic, which I feel is both better suited to my skillset, and is more novel research.
The premise of the research is that Western staff notation has been developed piece by piece, over hundreds of years, and lacks a formal schema that composers can use to construct new forms of notation and technique; 
This is especially urgent with the increasing uptake of new formats of engaging with scores reach critical mass (for example, the animated score was inaccessible and niche until iPads achieved mainstream adoption).
The construction of a `cookbook' that details the methods and elements of communicating musical ideas will assist adoption of new formats of presenting musical scores, future-proofing the format by genericizing actions, allowing composers to construct new notation in a logically consistent manner.
The works that I compose as the folio portion of this thesis will be practical examples of the application of this `cookbook', and demonstrate how composers can work within the Western staff notation system, or adapt it to fit their particular needs.
As an example, the work \emph{how to decay gracefully} (see 
% \autoref{app:howtodecaygracefullyscore}
the appendix for the score
) is the result of investigating how sections of music that are dictated by the rhythm of speech can be incorporated into Western staff notation.

To date, I have had one public performance of a work, composed two new works exploring the techniques that I have developed, and have been accepted to a composition workshop program in Sydney by Halcyon, a contemporary music ensemble.
Unfortunately, due to the Sydney lockdown, this has been postponed until restrictions ease, but will culminate in traveling to Sydney to have a new work workshopped by the ensemble.
