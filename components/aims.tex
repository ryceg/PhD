\begin{itemize}
   \item Develop my artistic voice and personal style through the incorporation of these extended techniques into my practice.
   \item Broaden the field of research by studying extended techniques that have not been extensively researched.
   \item Develop ways of communicating the best practices of techniques to increase their accessibility to others by formalising notation.
   % \item The best practice of how to produce the techniques will be synthesised by understanding the physical properties of the techniques and how they are produced. 
\end{itemize}


% My PhD is about building better music notation. 
% It can be thought of as taking an old house, and reconstructing blueprints of it, so that anyone can build extensions on it, and they know which walls they can knock down.
% I'm then building a catalogue of room designs that can replace parts of the existing structure, or be built as extensions;
% for composers that don't want to use rhythm as presented in Western staff notation, they can tear out those supporting beams, and replace it with 
% I'm looking at the Western staff notation that already exists, and breaking it down to its base elements, so I can construct building blocks for new notation out of that. 
% That, combined with my own set of rules that are developed from best-practice design and extrapolations from existing notation will help inform how to construct new techniques and notation. 
% The benefit of this is that it will help future-proof our notation for future technologies,
