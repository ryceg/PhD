    To whom it may concern,

My name is Rhys Gray, and I am a PhD student at the University of Tasmaniaâ€™s Conservatorium of Music. 
My research is focused around under--researched extended techniques, and their compositional applications. 
I am currently seeking interested participants that play an instrument at a professional level that would be willing to assist me. 
This would involve workshopping pieces for your instrument, and being interviewed about the pieces, techniques used, and process. 
These pieces would include extended techniques, such as multiphonics, overtones, subharmonics, and other non-standard methods of producing a sound on your instrument. 
This would be suitable for a musician that is interested in exploring new techniques, and collaborating with a composer on new works. 
Please note that this research has the potential to be personally identifiable, or, with consent, directly identify you if necessary. 
If you are interested, please contact me at rhys.gray@utas.edu.au with your name, instrument, and availability for further discussion.
