\subsection{Outputs}
My research into underexplored techniques will broaden the performative and compositional palette available to artists. 
Through the documentation of my process in researching this technique, it will be catalogued and brought into the literature, facilitating further development.


Through a comprehensive review of how composers construct their frontmatter, guidelines to how new and experimental techniques can be communicated to performers will be developed.
This will lower the friction of learning new works, and promote the uptake of contemporary works.
This will be further aided by the development of a \LaTeX style which can quickly scaffold the relevant extended techniques for consistent and universal verbiage.

The resultant thesis, `Writing Wrong Right: Composing With Extended Techniques', will consequently be a practical document, suitable as a reference for artists interested in implementing extended techniques into their practice.
