It is anticipated that at least three papers regarding the methods in which a composer can use the techniques researched will be produced. 
Additionally, the folio part of this study will be recorded, so it is anticipated that at least an hour's worth of original compositions will be compiled.
Depending on the state of CoVid-19, it is hoped that there will be chances to hold live performances of the compositions produced, which would be open to the public.
