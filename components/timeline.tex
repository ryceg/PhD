\section{Timeline}
A Gantt chart is included on the following page, detailing the rough timeline of objectives.
\subsection{Year 1}
\subsubsection{Research Milestones}
By the Confirmation of Candidature, I hope to have written a short paper detailing the compositional potential of double-touch harmonics.
This will require the completion of an ethics application, as well as organising several meetings with him.
I will be working with cellist John Addison on a notational system for the technique, as well as a reference document for usable double-touch harmonics for composers and performers alike.
\subsubsection{Compositional Output}
Collaborating with Addison will yield a cello trio, which will be workshopped and recorded.
From the results of the cello trio, a string quartet will be composed. 
\subsection{Year 2}
\subsubsection{Research Milestones}

\subsubsection{Compositional Output}
A violin (or violoncello, depending on the availability and results of research) concerto will be produced.
\subsection{Year 3}
