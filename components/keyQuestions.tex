    \item How have other artists used these techniques, and what can we learn from artists that have already incorporated them into their practice?
    \item How can I incorporate these extended techniques into my personal practice and develop a unique style with them?
    \item How well understood is the physical production, and are there ways we can improve production of the sound in a performance context?
    \item What variables impact the production of these techniques?
    \item What can we learn from the way that these techniques are physically produced?
